I decided to start up blogging again. My eyes have long been on [hugo](http://gohugo.io) as a blogging plattform.

My needs for blogging are:
 - blog showing actual syntax highlight code
 - blog using plantuml diagrams
 - blog using markdown

Hugo makes all of that possible although plantuml integration does not look to be as smooth as I want yes. More on that later.

I struggled for a long time finding a theme I like, for now I am kiera, but not sure it will stay that way. Needs for theme are:
 - fast
 - responsive
 - syntax highlighting using chroma (not highlightjs) since i want hl_lines and table linenumbers
 - simple
