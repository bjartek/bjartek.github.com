Hey I am Bjarte S. Karlsen and I am a developer, nerd and roleplaying geek. I think that sums it up pretty well. 

I am educated as a computer scientist from 'NTNU':http://www.ntnu.no specializing in system development. 

Most of my professional experience has thus far been in web development with the LAMP stack. I have also coded some applications for the Apple iPhone. 

On my spare time I like to learn, read and play roleplaying games. When I read/listen to fiction I prefer fantasy and science fiction in that order. Literature that is unrealistic and strange and that keeps my mind away from everyday concerns. When learning I liked to read books about computer languages, methodologies. I also have quite a healthy subscription list in my Google Reader and hang out at IRC and at twitter quite a lot. 

I play roleplaying games regulary every other tuesday. Currently I play DnD 4th edition and I like it quite a lot. I am also interrested in indie roleplaying games. I have quite a collection of roleplaying books, but I seldom get to use most of them :/ I also play boardgames, wargames and cardgames from time to time.
