Today I received the deadtree version of my "Programming in Scala/Stairway
book":http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala. I can't wait to read the
final paper version of the book. I have read most of the earlier betas but have
not had the time to read the final version yet. 

Good timing as well, just when my christmas break starts. 

Congrats to Bill, Martin, Lex, Artima and the Scala community.
