Yesterday I read about "GitHub Pages":http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages
and I just had to try it out. I think git it really cool and I love the work of
the github staff. They constantly improve their offering and that is something I
respect. 

In order to create this page I took my old blueprint based design and borrowed
some setup tips for Jekyll from "mojombo":http://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com/tree/master.

Keep up the good work github!
