I have been coding ever since i first touched a computer in 92, got my first part time job in 98 and my first full time job in 2006. I got a masters degree in informatics from NTNU in Norway.
I started my career writing PHP webapps, dabbled with iOS when the iPhone arrived , then i transitioned to the JVM and have been developing there pretty much since.</description></item></channel></rss>
