Since my sourcecode is on github and they offer free gh-pages and ci with github actions I see no reason why this simple blog should be hosted anywhere else.
The github workflow is pretty simple
On any push to master it will
fetch the site with submodules (to get the theme) generate png file from all the puml files in /static setup hugo version 0.</description></item><item><title>Blogging with BeatutifulHugo</title><link>https://bjartek.org/post/beatutifulhugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 21:13:23 +0200</pubDate><author>bjarte@bjartek.org (Bjarte S.

The criera I have for chooing a theme can be found in blogging
I tried so many themes that I cannot list them here before I find something I was happy with.

I started with reading the technical papers for flow and liked that the blockchain was PoS and that it had its own novel programming language Cadence that was resource oriented.
During OWB i became part of team23 that turned into versus. We are currently in the process of launching the concept live on mainnet these days.</description></item><item><title>Blogging with Puml</title><link>https://bjartek.org/post/puml/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 22:03:48 +0200</pubDate><author>bjarte@bjartek.org (Bjarte S.

As you might have realised I like working with things that are ascii text and not WYSIWYG.
Here is an example of a image that is generated using github actions. The PUML file resides in static in this repo and it generates a png when the site is built.</description></item><item><title>Blogging with code</title><link>https://bjartek.org/post/code/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 21:15:23 +0200</pubDate><author>bjarte@bjartek.org (Bjarte S.

My needs for blogging are:
blog showing actual syntax highligheten code blog using plantuml diagrams blog using markdown Hugo makes all of that possible although plantuml integration does not look to be as smooth as I want yes. More on that later.
I struggled for a long time finding a theme I like, for now I am kiera, but not sure it will stay that way.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://bjartek.org/page/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>bjarte@bjartek.org (Bjarte S.

I have been coding ever since i first touched a computer in 92, got my first part time job in 98 and my first full time job in 2006. I got a masters degree in informatics from NTNU in Norway.
I started my career writing PHP webapps, dabbled with iOS when the iPhone arrived , then i transitioned to the JVM and have been developing there pretty much since.</description></item></channel></rss>
